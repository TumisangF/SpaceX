# SpaceX

The objective of this project is to determine the price of each launch
of SpaceX Falcon 9. I will do this by gathering information about
Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I will also determine
if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. I will train a machine learning
model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the
first stage.
